#### Initial Overview

##### 1. Increase Testing
- Outsource to friends via deploying product on a web page (and incentivize on German / English Blog article).
##### 2. Algo Improvements
- Dismantle OpenCV Algorithm and try different setups: e.g., adaptive mask thresholding
- Consider integrating colour mask. J is not satisfied.
##### 3. Statistical Analysis
  - Support Happiness statement by including vertical/lateral movement of plant.
  - Also integrate the MFCC sounds into result.
##### 4. Result Visualization
- Depict results in graphs in multiple ways. Figure out what makes sense.
##### 5. Operational Improvements
- Create a progress bar.
- Read about OpenCV and Multi-Threading
### Non-project related
- Progress on Fluent Python (fundamentals in Python book): in Progress.
