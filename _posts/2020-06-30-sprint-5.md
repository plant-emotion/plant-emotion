### Sprint 5 - User Stories

- OpenCV Improvements: Outline, Implement and Document: Gait (Gabor Filter), Fish Schoals (Kalman + Otsu Thresh).
- Improvement of Data Analysis: integrate different types of movements (x; x/y; v(x); v(y)).

#### Bug Fixes / Optimization

- Get every 50th frame from video as img
```python
if frame%60 == 0:
  plt.plot(frame); plt.show()
```
- Make max / min video length
```python
if video_length < 15s:
  present_max_length = video_length
else:
  present_max_length = 15
```
- Try algos from research.
- Add additional videos.

Additional user stories after the next talk/t.b.d.
