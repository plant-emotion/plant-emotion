### Status Quo: Josephine's work, Sebastian's work  [40 min: 20 min each]

#### Status Quo: Josephine's work [20 min]

##### Status Quo
**A) Continuing analysis**

-> Bigger sample size allowed for grouping:
   
   Option 1. Happy vs Sad,
   
   Option 2. Male vs Female
   
Grouped as above, the following analyses were conducted:

- Correlation of Movement and MFCCs
- Lagged Correlation
- T-Test
- Regression

**B) Restructuring set up/ Renewing infrastructure**

- Combining individual analysis files and functions to a single MatLab script
    - To reduce redundancy and enable reusability, I initially wrote individual functions that can be used in different steps
      of the analysis
    - Wanting to share the code, I decided to consolidate everything into a single Jupyter notebook and add clear annotations
      to improve the reader's understanding   
- Converting MatLab script to Python. Advantages:

a) Optimized collaboration with Sebastian (easier exchange of code snippets)

b) Easier code sharing via GitHub

c) Multitude of Python Machine Learning libraries offers endless possibilities for integrating ML into the current project

##### Next Steps

1. Continue converting code to Python
2. Finish statistical analysis
3. Take time for documentation (also retrospective)
