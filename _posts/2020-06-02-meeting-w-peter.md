### Status Quo: Josephine's work, Sebastian's work  [40 min: 20 min each]

#### Status Quo: Josephine's work [20 min]

##### Status Quo
1. Finished Mimosa x MFCC Analysis with old data
2. Wrote script to split video into samples
3. Started analysis of new data: MFCC and Movement Analysis for all samples (started with Codariocalyx, soon to be followed by Mimosa)
4. Added lines of code to reliably calculate up-/down-time and rise-/fall-time for all samples
5. Having an increased sample size, I added some sub analyses to the initial procedure: Trend of correlation coefficients & MFCCs
6. Coded samples -> Happy/Sad, female/male -> Currently used for fitting regression model; soon to be used for trying some machine learning algorithms, eg classification
7. Outlined the bigger picture: Making it 2 papers? If so, structure of each. Checked how current research efforts fit in & what should be done additionally.

##### Next Steps

1. Continue analysis of new data
2. Detailed research model & plan
3. Find best way to integrate MFCC analysis into plan
4. Regression with controls
