During the weekend, Peter filmed three new videos with the alternating sounds for Mimosa Pudica and Codariocalyx.
This week, Sebastian will try to replicate the code of Josephine in Google Colab and try to get a virtual machine learning infrastructure delivering results.
This may proof useful as we are facing a huge amount of data now.

He will also need to dive into theory and reading.

Initial results of Sebastian were communicated for Thursday, May 21, 2020, EoD.
