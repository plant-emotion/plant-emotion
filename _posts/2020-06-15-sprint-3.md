### Sprint 3 - Defined Objectives

#### Project-related

##### 1. Increase Testing

Test more to find better hyper-parameters. Therefore, integrate hyper parameter cross-table.
- Did more testing, came up with alternative test data.
- In Sprint 4: Outsource to friends via deploying product on a web page (and incentivize on German / English Blog article).

##### 2. Data Wrangling

Cutting frames from video to account for the two plants. Consider the integration of a color mask.
- Dropped the frame cutting idea. Did not make sense.
- Consider integrating color mask. J is not satisfied.

##### 3. Statistical Analysis

Correlation, lagged correlation. -> Went for starting with happiness indicator.
- In Sprint 4:
    - Research more into OpenCV algorithm functionality.
    - Support Happiness statement by including vertical/lateral movement of plant.

##### 4. Result Visualization

Depict results in graphs. [Done with Altair.]

##### 5. Group Analysis

Cut video based on sound patterns into sequences to test for interactions (gender,  emotional expression). -> Moved to Sprint 4:
- In Sprint 4:
    - Cut videos to length of start 'sound stimuli' to end 'movement of plant completed' to account for correlations.
    - Is this useful?

##### 6. Operational Improvements

Improve slow video processing (make use of 26GB RAM, process on GPU, make progress of video processing visible).
- Integrated timer and starting time.
- In Sprint 4: Create a progress bar.

### Non-project related

- Progress on Fluent Python (fundamentals in Python book): in Progress (Working on Chapter 3: Sets and Dicts.)
- Try with different videos from Youtube (not carnivore plants): Done (Paprika, Flat fop).
- Published a blog article on Plantions on www.duerr.se in [German](https://seduerr91.github.io/blog/object-tracker_ger) and in [English](https://seduerr91.github.io/blog/object-tracker).
