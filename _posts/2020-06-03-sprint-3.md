### Sprint 3 - Objectives

#### Project-related
2. __Data Wrangling__: Cutting frames from video to account for the two plants. Consider the integration of a color mask.
3. __Statistical Analysis__: correlation, lagged correlation -> in Progress.
4. __Result Visualization__: Depict results in graphs/correlation tables. -> in Progress. -> Done.
5. __Group Analysis__: Cut video based on sound patterns into sequences to test for interactions (gender,  emotional expression).
6. __Operational Improvements__: Improve slow video processing (make use of 26GB RAM, process on GPU, make progress of video processing visible).

### Non-project related
- Progress on Fluent Python (fundamentals in Python book).
- Update Karenz-Roadmap by following [expert recommendations](https://seduerr91.github.io/blog/experts). -> Done.
- Try with different videos from Youtube (not carnivore plants). -> Done.
