2. __Data Wrangling__: Cutting frames from video to account for the two plants. Consider the integration of a color mask.
3. __Statistical Analysis__: correlation, lagged correlation -> in Progress.
4. __Result Visualization__: Depict results in graphs/correlation tables. -> in Progress.
5. __Group Analysis__: Cut video based on sound patterns into sequences to test for interactions (gender,  emotional expression).
6. __Operational Improvements__: Improve slow video processing (make use of 26GB RAM, process on GPU, make progress of video processing visible).
