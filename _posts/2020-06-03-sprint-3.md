### Sprint 3 - Objectives

#### Project-related
1. __Testing__: Test more to extract best hyper-parameters. Therefore, integrate hyper parameter cross-table. -> Did more testing, came up with alternative test data.
-> Done.
2. __Data Wrangling__: Cutting frames from video to account for the two plants. Consider the integration of a color mask.
-> Dropped. Did not make sense.
3. __Statistical Analysis__: correlation, lagged correlation
-> Went for starting with happiness indicator.
4. __Result Visualization__: Depict results in graphs/correlation tables.
-> Done.
5. __Group Analysis__: Cut video based on sound patterns into sequences to test for interactions (gender,  emotional expression).
-> In progress.
6. __Operational Improvements__: Improve slow video processing (make use of 26GB RAM, process on GPU, make progress of video processing visible).
-> Integrated timer and starting time.

### Non-project related
- Progress on Fluent Python (fundamentals in Python book).
-> in Progress
- Update Karenz-Roadmap by following [expert recommendations](https://seduerr91.github.io/blog/experts).
-> Done.
- Try with different videos from Youtube (not carnivore plants).
-> Done (Paprika, Flat fop).
