# Music Feature Extraction in Python

Source: [Music Extraction in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/extract-features-of-music-75a3f9bc265d)

## Packages

Weâ€™ll be using librosa for analyzing and extracting features of an audio signal.

For playing audio we will use pyAudio so that we can play music on jupyter directly.

    import librosa
    audio_path = 'audio-path'
    x , sr = librosa.load(audio_path)
    print(type(x), type(sr))

x = time series
sr = sample rate of x; consider overwriting to sr=44100

## Playing audio

  import IPython.display as ipd
  ipd.Audio(audio_path)

## Display methods

- wave plot: loudness of audio at given time
- spectrogram: show different frequencies along with amplitude
- colormap
- stft (short term fourier transform): determines the amplitude of various frequencies at a given time

## Feature Extraction

- Zero Crossing Rate: rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back

    x, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)
    #Plot the signal:
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
    librosa.display.waveplot(x, sr=sr)

- Zooming in:

    n0 = 9000
    n1 = 9100
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
    plt.plot(x[n0:n1])
    plt.grid()

- Spectral centroid: indicates where centre of mass for sound is located
- Spectral rolloff: is frequency under which a specified percentage of total spectral energy lies

- MFCC: mel frequency cepstral coefficients of a signal are a small set of features which concisely describe the overall shape of a spectral envelope

    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(x, sr=sr)
    print(mfccs.shape)
    #Displaying  the MFCCs:
    librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, sr=sr, x_axis='time')

# Dummy guide to MFCC

Summary: MFCC features represent phonemes (distinct units of sound) as the shape of the vocal tract (which is responsible for sound generation) is manifest in them.

## Term explanation

Cespstral is 'spectral' with 'spec' inverted. __Cepstrum is the information of rate of cahnge in spectral bands__.

Pitch is one of the characteristics of a speech signal and is measured as the frequency of the signal.

*Mel scale* is scale that relates the perceived frequency of a tone to the actual frequency because humans hear differently. They are better at identifying small changes in speech at lower frequencies.
