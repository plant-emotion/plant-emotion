# Learning OpenCV4 with Python

Reference: __Joseph Howse, Joe Minichino - Learning OpenCV 4 Computer Vision with Python 3: Get to grips with tools, techniques, and algorithms for computer vision and machine learning (2020)__

As of May 14, 2020, I progressed until the end of Chapter 6. Below you find my findings which I also published on a private Github with Josephine. Chapters 7 and 8 will be really useful too, so I may work on them at the weekends.

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1 - Setting up CV4

- Simply gives introduction on how to install OpenCV4 and why it is called cv2 etc. - Just for matter of comprehensiveness.
- I found it surprising to download the version with proprietary algorithms.

### Chapter 2 - Handling files, cameras and guis.

- Rather basic chapter that allows you to learn how to open files and watch them.
- Applied these to Jupyter notebooks, and changed imshow functions to these of matplotlib to make sure you can run them within a Jupyter notebook.
- Useful: We should ask Peter what kind of camera he is using, and consider using two cameras or depth cameras in the future.

### Chapter 3 - Processing images

- Different color models are being explained. It was intersting to understand differences between colors, and light (which is being diseminated by a screen).
- Further you learn about edge detection with Canny.
- Contour detection but also the detection of lines, circles, and other shapes.

### Chapter 4 - Depth Estimation and Segmentation

- Tried out the foreground detection with GrabCut with a sample plant video.
- Also tried the image segmentation with the Watershed algorithm.
- Conclusion: I realized that we should change the setting of the camera or find a way in order to get the plant in the foreground somehow. Maybe by setting up focus points for camera. **We will check for differences in the new videos provided by Peter**.

### Chapter 5 - Detecting and Recognizing Faces

- Was particular fun to play with. However, we examine plants and not faces. Yet find my fun image at the end of this quick post.
- Using Haar cascades I learnt that we should get something similar for our plants.
- Additional book by the author is mentioned in which he explains how to train for Haar cascade libraries. **Also it makes sense to research on existing libraries on google**.

### Chapter 6 - Retrieving images and Searching using Descriptors

- Was particularly useful for learning about Harris corners detector.
- I also learnt about SIFT and SURF, ORB and BRIEF.
- Appropriation to plantions.github.io: Coming from these algorithms, we will try to apply the functionality of FLANN KNN to detect the corners of our plants, respectively their leaves.
